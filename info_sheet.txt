Does your project run without error?: 

Unfortunatley, no it doesn't.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

Before I added the functionality for only displaying new messages to the user, posting new
messages was working find in all cases. Yet after I added this functionality I am getting
an error when I try to add a new message to a brand new chat (a chat with no previous messages). I 
have spent the past 3 hours using the chrome debugger trying to figure out what is causing this
and I just couldn't figure it out. Also, users can delete a chat room and all the corresponding
messages but others users are not displayed a message when this happens. Other than these 2 issues
everything else in my program is working.
